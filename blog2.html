    <h1>Optimizing WordPress for Speed</h1>

  <main class="blog-content">
    <p>During my internship as a WordPress developer, one of my main tasks was to optimize client websites for <b>speed and SEO</b>. Many websites were heavy due to plugins and unoptimized themes.</p>
    <h3>My Go-To Optimization Steps</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Removing unnecessary plugins and scripts</li>
      <li>Using lightweight, custom themes</li>
      <li>Optimizing images with compression tools</li>
      <li>Adding caching (e.g., WP Super Cache, LiteSpeed)</li>
      <li>Configuring CDN for global delivery</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As a result, I improved performance scores and reduced load times from 6+ seconds to under 2 seconds. This directly improved client SEO rankings.</p>
    <p>Lesson learned: <b>Speed matters as much as design.</b></p>
