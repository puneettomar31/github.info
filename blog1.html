    <p>Laravel has been my go-to framework for building robust applications. Its elegant syntax, MVC structure, and built-in features like authentication and Eloquent ORM make development faster and cleaner.</p>
    <p>When I started learning Laravel, I focused on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Understanding routes and controllers</li>
      <li>Working with Blade templates for views</li>
      <li>Building CRUD functionality using Eloquent</li>
      <li>Securing authentication and user roles</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In my professional projects (like <b>E-Commerce backend</b> and <b>Job Board App</b>), Laravel allowed me to deliver scalable solutions with clean APIs and optimized queries.</p>
    <p>If you’re starting out, my advice is: <i>learn the basics, practice CRUD apps, then move to APIs and advanced features like queues and broadcasting.</i></p>
